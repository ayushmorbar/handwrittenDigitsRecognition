# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Neural Networks

This project implements a basic neural network (NN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It demonstrates how deep learning models can classify images of digits (0-9).

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8
- TensorFlow & Keras
- Numpy & Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Train the model:
    ```sh
    python src/train.py
    ```

3. Evaluate and visualize results:
    ```sh
    python src/evaluation.py
    ```

## Results
Confusion matrices, accuracy plots, and trained models are saved in the `results/` and `models/` directories.

## Future Work
- Data augmentation for improving CNN performance.
- Experimenting with more advanced CNN architectures like ResNet.
